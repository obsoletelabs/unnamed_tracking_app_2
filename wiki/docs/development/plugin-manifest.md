# Plugin Manifest, Compatibility & Dependencies

This document defines the static manifest and dependency rules implemented for Plugin Manager v1.

## Manifest

A manifest declares:

- stable plugin ID and semantic version;
- display name and description;
- safe plugin entrypoint;
- Plugin SDK compatibility range;
- application compatibility range;
- capability requests;
- static namespaced or privileged backend route declarations;
- human-readable permission rationales;
- required and optional plugin dependencies;
- declarative settings, actions, pages and menu identifiers;
- an optional sandboxed `frontend` bundle and optional privileged `native_frontend` bundle;
- namespaced storage quota;
- SHA-256 package integrity and optional signature metadata.

The manifest is validated as data before plugin code is loaded. Unknown fields and unsafe or malformed values are rejected.

## Compatibility

New plugins require `api_contract_version: "1.1.0"` in both the manifest and UI
document. Missing declarations remain v1.0.0. Shipped historical examples and
already-installed plugins have limited legacy support, with an install warning;
native UI, themes, shortcuts and built-in placement need a v1.1 update. Other new
v1.0 packages remain incompatible. Plugin release versions remain separate.
See [the migration guide](plugin-v1.1-migration.md).

SDK and application compatibility are independent. A plugin must satisfy both ranges before activation.

Supported range forms are exact versions, comparisons, caret/tilde ranges, and bounded x/* minor/major wildcards. Invalid ranges are rejected.

An incompatible plugin is classified as incompatible and the activation decision is quarantine rather than execution. This prevents an incompatible extension from blocking core startup.

## Migration

Manifest version migration is a pure dictionary transformation. Known legacy field aliases are converted to the v1 names, while ambiguous fields or unsupported manifest versions are rejected. Migration never imports or executes plugin code.

## Dependencies

Permission declarations correspond one-to-one with declared capabilities and must use the same capability version. Dependencies identify another plugin and a semantic-version range. Required dependencies must exist and satisfy their range. Optional dependencies may be absent or incompatible without blocking the plugin.

The resolver:

1. validates dependency versions;
2. rejects missing required dependencies;
3. rejects required version conflicts;
4. detects dependency cycles;
5. produces deterministic dependency-first installation order.

Dependency resolution must complete before plugin activation.

## Security boundary

Manifest metadata does not grant capabilities. Gateway authorization remains responsible for enforcing grants. The application verifies package digest/signature/trust before installation, and the runtime independently verifies the archive/digest before atomically installing it. Plugin code is not imported during either verification pass.

Backend routes declare a stable ID, scope, path, methods, handler entrypoint, and host-enforced authorization policy. Normal relative paths require `backend.routes.plugin`; direct `/api/...` host paths require `backend.routes.host`. Conflicting routes, reserved plugin-management paths, missing capabilities, unsafe segments, and dynamic/literal route ambiguity are rejected statically.

The existing `frontend` declaration always means a sandboxed iframe bundle. A
`native_frontend` declaration is a separate, privileged contract and is valid only
when the manifest requests `frontend.native`. Its entry and styles live below
`native/`; the runtime serves them from a distinct endpoint, and the application
host only exposes that endpoint and activates the bundle while the exact grant is
effective for an enabled compatible installation.

These fields and capability names are additive Plugin API v1 contracts. Existing v1 manifests remain valid. Any future incompatible contract must use an explicit manifest/API migration rather than changing v1 interpretation in place.

## Host-managed schedules

A v1.1 plugin can declare up to 32 `scheduled_tasks`, with a stable task `id`,
`name`, `description`, `action_id` and integer minimum, maximum and default
intervals in minutes. Bounds must be within one minute and thirty days, and the
default must fit the declared range. The manifest must explicitly request
`tasks.background`. Each action must exist in `ui.json`, have a handler and
require no interactive confirmation. Package validation rejects invalid targets
before execution.

Schedules appear in Administration → Tasks and start off. They use the existing
background administrator identity and live action grants, never the identity of
who presses Run now. Disabled plugins, revoked access and runtime outages pause
the controls. Existing scheduling persistence survives updates within the same
installation identity. See [Tasks](../administration/tasks.md) for host controls
and the [companion recipe](https://obsoletelabs.github.io/unnamed_tracking_app_plugins/development/background-tasks/)
for a bounded action example.
