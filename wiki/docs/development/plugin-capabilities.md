# Plugin capability APIs

Plugin API v1 maps domain gateway methods to their required capabilities. The runtime
attaches its own plugin/installation identity, the authenticated action user (or the
installation's activation user for background requests), request ID, and requested
capability/version. The host checks the live installation and persisted grants for
every operation. Runtime-local storage/settings and delivery use the side-effect-free
`capabilities.check` method to recheck their required capability before execution.
Browser controls and manifest/UI/route declarations never authorize operations.

Grants must match the installation, capability version and user/device scope. The
current browser/runtime transports have no authenticated device identity and cannot
consume device-scoped grants. A grant from another installation is denied even when
`plugin_id` matches. Revocation takes effect at the next authorization check.

## Hierarchical grants

Capabilities use a canonical hierarchy. An administrator can grant one leaf, such as `games.read`, or its parent, `games`, which authorizes all current children in that subtree. A leaf never authorizes its parent or a sibling. The grant remains scoped to the installation, capability version, and optional user/device identity.

The principal families are:

- user data: `users`, `games`, `media`, `documents`, and `sessions`;
- frontend: navigation locations, Settings sections, overlays/dialogs, page extensions, page-scoped replacements, plugin routes, `frontend.shortcuts`, and `frontend.native`;
- backend: namespaced plugin routes and privileged host routes;
- notifications: sending notifications and registering/delivering through providers;
- external access: `network.outbound`.

`api.full` is a critical, exceptional backend grant. It implies the registered backend/domain API capabilities, but deliberately does not imply `frontend.native`, frontend contributions, or unrestricted network access. The install and permission-review APIs return the canonical category, hierarchy, risk, and high-privilege metadata so clients do not maintain a competing permission catalogue.

## Domain APIs

| Capability | Methods | Returned data and limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `documents.read` | `documents.list`, `documents.read` | User-owned game-document metadata and at most 5 MiB of base64 PDF or UTF-8 plain text. No filesystem paths, HTML, SVG, active content, or arbitrary binary data. |
| `sessions.read` | `sessions.list` | Caller-owned session IDs, state/current indication, timestamps, IP/user agent, approximate location/network/ASN, and anomaly context. No cookies, tokens, or hashes. Filtered cursor pages default to 50, maximum 200. |
| `sessions.revoke` | `sessions.revoke`, `sessions.revoke_all` | Confirmed caller-owned revocation sets `revoked_at`, retaining audit metadata. Separate from read permission. |
| `sessions.admin.read` | `sessions.admin.list` | Cross-user filtered session metadata; active administrator role independently required. |
| `sessions.admin.revoke` | `sessions.admin.revoke`, `sessions.admin.revoke_user`, `sessions.admin.revoke_all` | Confirmed admin single, selected-user, or server-wide revocation. |
| `sessions.geoip.read` | `sessions.geoip.status` | Administrator-only City/Country/Network availability booleans; no filesystem paths. |
| `sessions.geoip.configure` | Multipart capability endpoint | Administrator-only confirmed MMDB replacement, bounded to 256 MiB and validated by the host. |
| `media.write` | `media.import` | Imports normalized movie metadata into the authenticated user media library; plugins never receive ORM objects. |
| `tasks.background` | Approved background execution and v1.1 host schedules | Allows a plugin to remain active for approved work and expose explicitly declared Tasks jobs; schedule controls start off and live action grants and process limits still apply. |
| `notifications.send` | `notifications.send` | Creates a user-scoped in-app notification; core then creates eligible provider delivery rows. |
| `notification_providers.register` | `notification_providers.register`, `notification_providers.unregister` | Registers a provider ID namespaced below the plugin ID and one declared action ID. |
| `notification_providers.deliver` | Core invokes the registered action | Allows minimized eligible delivery work after core preference/grant checks. It does not allow querying notification tables or controlling retries. |

Existing leaves include `users.read`, `users.profile.read`, `games.read`, `games.write`, `media.read`, `media.write`, `events.subscribe`, `plugin.storage`, and `plugin.settings`. `home.replace` and `app.global` remain host-owned legacy UI extension slots. A plugin can contribute declarative UI to those slots but cannot mutate Vue components or the DOM. External navigation actions must explicitly declare `external_navigation` and are limited to HTTP(S) URLs.

Frontend context leaves are `frontend.context.game`,
`frontend.context.media`, and `frontend.context.documents`. Context values are
reconstructed and authorized at the backend action boundary rather than trusted
from browser-supplied action values. `frontend.native` is the only capability that
permits a verified bundle to register Vue components or CSS in the host document;
it remains critical-risk and is not implied by any navigation or page capability.

Only methods present in the gateway dispatch table are callable; presenting a different capability string does not change the method's authorization requirement.

## Errors and action results

Denied grants return 403 at the host boundary. Invalid, missing, or out-of-scope resource identifiers produce bounded validation/not-found errors without disclosing whether another user's resource exists. Plugin actions return structured JSON and a host-generated `request_id` suitable for correlating administrator diagnostics.

One-shot action handlers use the same mediated request/response protocol as long-running plugins. They do not receive host credentials or a direct network connection.

`media.sync`, `network.request`, and opt-in background task delegation use the existing `media.write`, `network.outbound`, and `tasks.background` grants. See [Plugin API v1](plugin-api-v1.md#provider-media-synchronization-background-subscriptions-and-outbound-json) for payloads, target-user consent and conflict handling.

## Metadata provider extension (1.1.1)

Search and refresh use the hardcoded core providers and optional installed provider plugins
through one shared metadata handler. Core search does not require the plugin runtime.
Provider configuration and health appear in the host's metadata settings.
See [the progressive metadata contract](../development/metadata-providers.md) for
phase separation, scoped credential migration, deadlines and persistence behavior.
