## Development layout

Backend development happens under `src/backend`; frontend development happens under `src/frontend`.

Keep backend-only logic in the backend and frontend-only behavior in the frontend. Configuration rules belong in the backend configuration registry rather than being duplicated in Vue components.

## Backend checks

The backend CI uses Python 3.12 and runs:

- backend pytest (with PostgreSQL and an Alembic upgrade);
- plugin runtime policy tests;
- Alembic migration graph validation;
- Python module size validation;
- mypy;
- pylint;
- Ruff format and lint.

These checks run independently. A database setup, test, size, or formatting failure does not skip unrelated checks. Database-backed tests still require a successful migration upgrade. The CI migration check requires a valid single Alembic head. The final `backend-checks` summary preserves the repository's required status name and fails if any backend job, including the reusable pylint check, fails or is skipped.

Pylint uses the shared `pyproject.toml` configuration and fails below 10/10. Missing docstrings are reviewed for usefulness instead of requiring boilerplate on every symbol. SQLAlchemy and Pydantic data models are exempt from the minimum public-method count; service classes remain checked. Correctness and complexity checks remain enabled.

Ruff checks the submitted commit. A separate job applies safe fixes and formatting to same-repository PR branches, including draft PRs. Fork PRs receive the read-only checks. The writer checks the PR head before pushing and never force-pushes. GitHub may require approval to run workflows after a bot updates a PR; follow the PR's workflow approval banner or push a normal follow-up commit. See [GitHub's workflow trigger behavior](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-when-workflows-run/trigger-a-workflow).

See the [backend quality rework checkpoint](backend-quality.md) for the suppression audit and remaining cleanup.

For local checks:

```bash
cd src/backend
mypy --config-file pyproject.toml src
pylint --rcfile=pyproject.toml src
```

Run tests with the development database available:

```bash
docker compose exec -e PYTHONPATH=/app backend python -m pytest tests -q
```

## Frontend checks

From `src/frontend`:

```bash
npm run format
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test
```

## Database changes

Use Alembic for schema changes.

- Add a new migration instead of editing a migration that has already shipped.
- Keep one migration head.
- Test migrations against a fresh database and an existing database where practical.
- Do not use destructive database recreation as the normal development workflow.

## Configuration changes

For a new environment-backed setting:

1. Add it to the backend configuration registry.
2. Choose ENV, SETUP, or BOTH ownership.
3. Define validation, defaults, visibility, and secrecy.
4. Add explicit persistence mapping if application-owned.
5. Add a safe example to `example.env`.
6. Update the wiki Environment Variables page.
7. Add focused tests for resolution, validation, locking, and secret handling as applicable.

Do not add real credentials to `example.env`.

## Integration changes

If changing OIDC or Playnite behavior, verify the actual API/client contract before documenting it.

In particular:

- OIDC callback paths are generated from the current application address unless a deployment callback URI is explicitly configured.
- OIDC login requires `sub` and an email identity claim, but does not require `email_verified=true`.
- Playnite authenticates with a user API key and uses the `playnite_guid`/folder association for game matching.

## Pull requests

Keep pull requests focused on one change where practical.

For bug fixes, include the related GitHub issue reference in the pull request so the issue can be automatically closed when the PR is merged.

Document user-facing behavior changes in the wiki when they affect setup, configuration, deployment, or normal application usage.

## Reporting issues

Use the three issue forms for bugs, feature requests, and engineering tasks. Bug reports should include the exact application version, deployment method, reproduction, and relevant logs. Feature requests should describe the affected user and expected outcome. Maintenance tasks should include acceptance criteria and verification steps, with links to failing CI jobs where applicable.

Report host Plugin API, plugin manager, and runtime problems in this repository. Report problems within an individual plugin in that plugin's repository. Remove credentials and private data from attached evidence.

## Frontend checks

The frontend CI runs, from `src/frontend`:

- `npm run format` (Prettier; CI also runs `format:fix` and commits the result);
- `npm run lint`;
- `npm run typecheck` (vue-tsc; the production build runs the same check, so a type error also breaks the Docker image);
- `npm run test`.

## File size limits

Source files are kept small enough to read:

- Python modules (outside migrations) must be 1,000 lines or fewer. Pylint suppression comments do not bypass this independent CI check.
- Frontend files are limited to 2,000 lines by ESLint (`max-lines`). A short list of files that were already larger when the rule was added is exempted in `eslint.config.js`. Split those up and remove them from the list, rather than adding to it.

If a file is near its limit, move cohesive pieces into their own modules or components.

## Shell scripts and line endings

Shell scripts under `src/docker-container/` must use LF line endings. A Windows checkout with `core.autocrlf` turns them into CRLF, which breaks them inside the Linux image (`exec ./entrypoint.sh: no such file or directory`). CI checks out with LF, but build the image from LF copies if you build it by hand on Windows.
