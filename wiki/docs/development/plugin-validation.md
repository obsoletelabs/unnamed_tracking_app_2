# Plugin integration validation

Validation is split between the host repository and the independent plugin repository so neither side imports the other's private implementation.

For reusable checks of an installed plugin and the full real-worker runner, see
[Installed-plugin conformance](plugin-conformance.md). That page lists the exercised
lifecycle/permission cases, source-revision evidence, browser screenshots and limits.

## Host coverage

The application tests:

- manifest, compatibility, dependency, archive, digest, and publisher-trust validation;
- contextual installation consent, exact installation/user grants, revocation, and disabled-plugin rejection;
- runtime process isolation, private storage, frontend asset confinement, action mediation, structured diagnostics, and restart state;
- allowlisted sidebar/native extension contributions and sandboxed custom frontends;
- document ownership, path confinement, type/encoding/size rejection, and safe DTOs;
- minimized session listing and user-scoped revocation;
- provider registration, preference/grant checks, delivery results, retries, and cleanup.

## Plugin repository coverage

`obsoletelabs/unnamed_tracking_app_plugins` tests every maintained manifest, permission rationale, source import boundary, frontend entry, package digest, and package validation rule. The maintained reference plugins exercise their exact public capabilities and host lifecycle contracts; retired packages remain covered by immutable release-history validation rather than current reference-plugin acceptance.

Normal development builds are unsigned and intentionally exercise the untrusted-package warning. Release builds require the private reviewed signing key and fail closed when the signer is unavailable or out of scope.

## Cross-repository acceptance

For a release candidate:

1. Build the four current `.utp` packages from the plugin repository.
2. Preview/install them through the application's real Plugin Manager.
3. Confirm denied permissions fail, approved permissions work, and revocation takes effect immediately.
4. Confirm sidebar pages disappear on disable/uninstall.
5. Exercise document missing/unsupported/oversized cases, session confirmation/revocation, and provider success/retry/disabled preference behavior.
6. Update a package, confirm consent does not broaden silently, and inspect redacted diagnostics.
7. Run both repositories' complete CI workflows and `mkdocs build --strict`.

See [Reference plugins](reference-plugins.md) and the [documentation review checklist](documentation-review.md).

## Repeatable repository lifecycle acceptance

`tools/check_plugin_repository_lifecycle.py` runs the current host against actual
packages built by a separate plugin checkout. Run it only against a disposable,
migrated PostgreSQL database with the backend requirements and the plugin
builder's `jsonschema` dependency installed:

```bash
python tools/check_plugin_repository_lifecycle.py \
  --plugins-root /path/to/unnamed_tracking_app_plugins \
  --work-root /tmp/plugin-acceptance
```

The work root must not exist. The runner downloads and inspects all current official
packages, creates signed releases with a disposable publisher registered only
inside its temporary test environment, and runs separate authenticated host and
runtime processes. It performs a real Jellyfin sync against a deterministic
Jellyfin HTTP server and verifies configuration, secrets and progress bytes
through restart, update, rollback and reinstall. It also checks permission
staging/revocation, release opt-out/opt-in, startup failure recovery, notifications,
retention, management-token scope isolation, confirmed purge and uninstall.
Only acquisition of the simulated release catalogue is substituted; the official
downloads, public gateway, runtime HTTP and workers are real.

Add `--browser` after building `src/frontend` and installing the plugin
repository's npm/Playwright dependencies to verify rendered catalogue filtering,
README, scope counts, risk bubbles, consent, duplicate choices, native UI and
Updates Available actions. `Plugin repository integration` runs this complete
acceptance in CI and retains logs and screenshots. The runtime deliberately
permits reduced isolation inside this disposable test environment and verifies
that the UI reports it accurately; real Bubblewrap namespace capability is
probed and the runtime unit suite also covers usable/unsupported policy behavior.
