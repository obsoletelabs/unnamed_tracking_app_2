# Plugin UI protocol

Plugin UI v1 is a declarative, versioned document exchanged through the
authenticated Plugin Gateway. The core renders fixed primitives by default. A
plugin may additionally declare an iframe frontend or an explicitly permissioned
native bundle without changing the declarative schema's trust level.

## Schema

A PluginUiDocument contains:

- settings sections and fields (text, textarea, password, number, boolean, select, multiselect);
- explicit validation constraints;
- write-only secret fields (no defaults or secret values in the UI document);
- actions carrying optional capability references and confirmation text;
- read-only tables;
- dialogs that reference declared actions;
- menus that target local pages or declared actions;
- pages that compose those primitives;
- navigation, Settings sections, host-page extensions, overlays/dialogs,
  contextual actions, plugin-owned routes, and page-scoped replacements.

All identifiers are stable lowercase IDs. Schema version v1 is negotiated as part of the Plugin API version rather than inferred from frontend implementation details.

## Security boundary

The document is data, not executable UI code. Labels/descriptions are plain text, external URLs and arbitrary HTML are not part of the schema, and menu/page references are validated before rendering. The host treats capability declarations as metadata only: the gateway remains authoritative for authorization.

Secret fields are represented only by their metadata. Existing secret values are never returned in a UI document or default value. A renderer uses a password control and sends a value only when explicitly submitted.

## Compatibility

Page replacements include `sessions` and `admin-sessions`, each requiring its exact grant: `frontend.page.replace.sessions` or `frontend.page.replace.admin-sessions`. These high-risk permissions are independent of `frontend.page.replace.settings`, `frontend.settings` and session read/revoke grants. They replace only the matching built-in Settings section and do not create additional navigation entries. The host reserves the `sessions` and `admin-sessions` settings IDs, enforces administrator visibility for the latter, and falls back to the basic page when no healthy enabled replacement is authorized. Existing order/plugin-ID/contribution-ID conflict resolution applies. The Advanced sessions switch selects between the basic page (`basic=1` in the Settings query) and an available replacement.

Unknown schema versions must be rejected or rendered as an unsupported-plugin state. New schema versions must add semantics without silently changing the meaning of existing v1 fields.

## Executable UI modes

`frontend.entry` is loaded only in the sandboxed iframe. `native_frontend` is
loaded into the Vue host only when the enabled installation has
`frontend.native`; its module can register components for page IDs already
declared by this document. The host owns registration, stylesheet,
failure-isolation, and cleanup lifecycle.

Native component instances are scoped to the plugin ID and page ID. Switching
pages unmounts the previous instance and mounts a fresh one, even when both pages
register the same component. Changes to context within the same page preserve
the instance. Page navigation does not reactivate the native bundle.

Declared action confirmation is handled in both modes and enforced on the host
action endpoint. Requests use strict boolean `confirmed` (default false). Native
`host.runAction` returns `{ cancelled: true }` when confirmation is declined.

## Custom frontend sandbox

See [Custom plugin frontend sandbox design](plugin-ui-sandbox.md). The authenticated
gateway remains the application boundary for both executable modes.

## Opaque sandbox asset delivery

An opt-in `frontend.inline_assets: true` manifest flag lets a verified package use classic scripts and CSS in a cookie-isolated iframe. The authenticated entry response resolves only relative package assets within `frontend/`, embeds them with a fresh CSP nonce, and escapes raw-text closing tags. Limits are 32 assets and 8 MiB combined content. External URLs, traversal, query/fragment sources and module scripts are rejected. Asset endpoints remain authenticated; no origin/native privilege or unsafe-eval grant is added. The default remains false for existing frontends.

Game Docs reader declarations, document context and the original-download bridge are described in [Scoped document API](plugin-documents.md).
