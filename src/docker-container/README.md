# Production container

This directory contains the single-container production packaging for Unnamed Tracking. It is separate from the development frontend/backend images.

The image contains the compiled Vue frontend, FastAPI, Nginx, and the independent startup/diagnostic layer. The combined image asks FastAPI for the effective real-IP configuration before rendering Nginx; the split development frontend/backend images remain independent and do not use this handoff. FastAPI listens only on the container loopback interface; Nginx is the public edge.

## Startup and readiness

PID 1 starts Nginx with the diagnostic configuration before PostgreSQL or FastAPI are ready. It then validates database configuration, waits for PostgreSQL, applies migrations, starts FastAPI, selects `ready.conf` (HTTP), `readytls.conf` (HTTPS), or `readytlsredirect.conf` (HTTPS plus HTTP redirect), renders TLS certificate paths when required, copies the selected production configuration to `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`, validates it, reloads Nginx, and verifies the frontend.

The startup page is served directly by Nginx before the backend is available. Its small static assets provide the UI; the entrypoint updates a small status JSON file and detail logs. Once FastAPI is healthy, Nginx reloads into the production configuration. Since that reload is asynchronous, readiness waits until a loopback request returns the compiled application document. A successful response from an old startup worker is insufficient to publish `READY`.

The Docker healthcheck is intentionally stricter than “Nginx is alive”: it is healthy only when the file-backed status reports `overall=ready`. During startup and after controlled startup failures the container can remain alive so operators can inspect the diagnostics, but Docker health remains unhealthy.

SIGTERM and SIGINT are handled by PID 1. The backend receives SIGTERM and is waited on before Nginx is asked to quit. This keeps the startup diagnostics available during failures without leaving child processes behind during normal container shutdown.

## Runtime permissions

The Nginx master remains privileged because the production image binds ports 80/443 and controls the Nginx process lifecycle. Nginx workers run as `www-data`.

The FastAPI process remains under the container entrypoint’s runtime user because it must retain access to the application and deployment-mounted state. Do not assume a rootless container until the persistent-data and Nginx lifecycle requirements have been validated for the target deployment.

Runtime status and diagnostics live under `/run/unnamed-tracking`. Application data is mounted separately at `/data`; PostgreSQL data is owned by the database service.

## Logs and persistence

Startup details and the backend startup log are file-backed under `/run/unnamed-tracking` and are therefore ephemeral container diagnostics. Nginx access/error logs are written under the container’s Nginx log directory.

For persistent operational logging, use the container runtime’s logging driver or an external log collector. Do not treat the container’s ephemeral log directory as a durable archive.

The Compose deployment persists `./data:/data` and PostgreSQL’s named volume. Backups should cover application data and PostgreSQL data according to the deployment’s backup policy.

## Nginx

The production configuration keeps the startup diagnostics available after readiness. API requests are proxied to FastAPI with Host, client-address, forwarded-for, and forwarded-protocol headers. Proxy timeouts are bounded.

### Restoring the real client IP

Production Nginx enables the ngx_http_realip_module by default. X-Forwarded-For is used recursively, but only when the immediate proxy address belongs to the trusted-proxy set. The default trusted set is only IPv4/IPv6 loopback (127.0.0.1/32 and ::1/128). Cloudflare, local/private, CGNAT/VPS, and custom ranges are opt-in through Settings/setup or deployment environment variables. Nginx's real-IP module only trusts addresses explicitly listed with set_real_ip_from; recursive processing selects the last non-trusted address in the forwarded chain. See the NGINX real-IP documentation at https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_realip_module.html and Cloudflare's published IP ranges at https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/.

Set NGINX_REALIP_HEADER to use a different header, such as CF-Connecting-IP for a deployment that wants Cloudflare's single-value client-IP header.

NGINX_REALIP_TRUSTED_PROXIES is a space-separated list of addresses/CIDRs. A non-empty environment value overrides the saved/default list; when it is unset, Settings/setup can persist the selected ranges. This is useful when the container is behind a different proxy/load-balancer topology or when the operator wants a deliberately narrower trust boundary.

Only trusted proxy source addresses can cause the configured header to replace Nginx's client address. Do not add public or untrusted networks to the override merely to make forwarded IPs appear correct.

Nginx hides its version and emits security headers for the production frontend/HTTPS edge. HSTS is emitted only by the HTTPS server.

## Optional embedded HTTPS/TLS

HTTP-only is the default. Configure embedded TLS under **Settings → Administration → Application → HTTPS / TLS**, during setup, or through the existing environment registry. Environment values take precedence and lock the corresponding fields. Saving in the production container renders a candidate, runs `nginx -t`, replaces the active configuration atomically, gracefully reloads Nginx and confirms new workers are serving it before committing settings. Invalid configuration or a failed database commit restores the previous active configuration. The backend does not require a Docker socket or restart the application.

Saving TLS settings also activates renewed certificate files when their paths are unchanged. There is no separate reload button. Mount certificate/key files read-only; the UI accepts their absolute container paths, never file contents. If TLS is enabled without certificate/key paths, the image first uses a complete certificate/key pair already present at `/etc/nginx/tls/tls.crt` and `/etc/nginx/tls/tls.key`; otherwise it generates a self-signed localhost certificate/key pair under `/run/unnamed-tracking/tls`. The conventional `/etc/nginx/tls` paths also fall back to the generated pair when those files are not mounted. Explicit non-default certificate/key paths remain supported for production. TLS itself remains disabled by default.

Publish port 443 before enabling HTTPS. Enable HTTP redirection only after confirming external HTTPS access. The development frontend/backend stack saves settings for production but cannot reload Nginx because it does not run the embedded listener. Changing container environment variables still requires recreating the container; UI/setup changes to unlocked fields apply immediately and survive restart. The healthcheck follows HTTP-to-HTTPS redirection and accepts the container's loopback self-signed certificate.

Set:

```text
NGINX_TLS_ENABLED=true
NGINX_TLS_CERTIFICATE=/etc/nginx/tls/tls.crt
NGINX_TLS_PRIVATE_KEY=/etc/nginx/tls/tls.key
NGINX_TLS_REDIRECT_HTTP=true
```

`NGINX_TLS_REDIRECT_HTTP` is optional and defaults to false. When enabled, HTTP redirects to HTTPS after the production configuration is activated. During startup failure, the diagnostic HTTP listener remains available so a broken certificate does not hide the diagnostic page.

Mount externally managed certificates read-only, for example:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./tls:/etc/nginx/tls:ro
```

The private key should be readable only by the container runtime/Nginx master as appropriate for the deployment. Never commit certificate or key material.

TLS configuration accepts TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3. Missing, unreadable, malformed, or mismatched certificate/key files cause production Nginx validation to fail and are reported through startup diagnostics. Private-key contents are not logged.

For HTTPS deployments, set `AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE=true`. Nginx forwards the original protocol to FastAPI and Uvicorn trusts that header only from the local Nginx hop, allowing request-derived OIDC callback URLs to retain the HTTPS scheme.

Certificate rotation does not require rebuilding the image: replace the mounted files and restart/reload the production container according to the deployment’s certificate-management procedure.

## Resource guidance

Production sizing depends on the number of users, scheduled jobs, metadata work, media operations, and PostgreSQL workload. Start with at least 2 CPU cores and 2 GiB RAM for a small deployment and monitor actual CPU, memory, database, and disk usage before tightening limits. PostgreSQL and application workloads should be sized independently when traffic grows.

Run `src/docker-container/smoke/run.sh` against the built image to validate PostgreSQL, migrations, JSON startup responses, frontend/API handoff, authentication and controlled shutdown.
