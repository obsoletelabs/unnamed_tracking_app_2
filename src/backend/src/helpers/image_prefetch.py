"""Downloading artwork as soon as it is saved, so no page waits on another site.

A movie, show or anime keeps the address of its poster and backdrop, and an
achievement the address of its icon. Whenever one of those rows is written
(added, imported, edited or refreshed from a metadata source) the picture is
fetched into this server's own cache in the background, using the same files
the image routes serve. A picture that could not be fetched is left for the
route to try again, and to redirect to the original if it still cannot.

Switched on by the app at startup; until then (tests, scripts) it does nothing.
