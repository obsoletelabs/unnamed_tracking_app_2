"""API routes for pulling a user's owned-games library + achievements from
Steam, PlayStation, and RetroAchievements straight into their library — a
different mechanism from `games.py`'s `/metadata/search`, which enriches one
already-added game by title. This creates/updates real `Game` rows and
`Achievement` rows in bulk from an account-wide library call.

Xbox is deliberately not here: a real library pull needs a full OAuth
consent redirect (Microsoft identity platform + Xbox Live XASU/XSTS token
exchange) that requires the user's own registered Azure AD app and a
redirect URI this server hosts — Settings only stores the client
id/secret today (see MetadataSourcesSection's Xbox card), it can't complete
that flow yet.
