"""Which spelling of an anime's title to show.

`title` is the canonical one the rest of the app stores and searches by. The
English, romaji and Japanese spellings (from AniList) sit beside it, and the
user's `title_language` preference decides which one is displayed. If the
preferred spelling is not known for a title, the next best is used and
finally `title`, so a title is never blank."""
