    """A bulk-uploaded screenshot/clip/soundtrack not yet assigned to a
    game. Previously tracked only as a bare file on disk with no DB row at
    all — that meant no real upload date (the design called for one under
    each thumbnail) and no way to soft-delete, unlike every other delete
    path in the app. deleted_at follows the same pattern as
    GameArchive/GameArchiveVersion: NULL means active, set means trashed —
    the file itself moves to a sibling _trash folder (see
    features/trash/inbox_trash.py) and features/trash/sweep.py purges both
    after 7 days."""
